# Prompt: Modeling (Baseline)

Role: senior data analyst + practical ML engineer.

Goal
- Build a baseline modeling plan with verifiable steps.

Data
- data/raw/train.csv
- data/raw/test.csv

Constraints
- Treat all modeling suggestions as hypotheses.
- Report assumptions and how to validate them.

Tasks
1) Define a baseline pipeline (preprocess + model).
2) Specify train/validation split strategy and metrics.
3) Identify 2-3 candidate models for a fast baseline.
4) Provide a minimal reproducible training loop outline.

Output format
- Pipeline: steps with brief rationale.
- Validation: metrics + expected output artifacts.
- Risks: leakage, target distribution drift, and feature stability.
